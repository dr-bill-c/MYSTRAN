      SUBROUTINE GEN_T0L (RGRID_ROW, ICORD, THETAD, PHID, T0L )
 
! Generates 3x3 transformation matrix, T0L, to basic (0) coordinate system from another coordinate system (L) with internal coord
! system number ICORD at the grid whose RGRID data is at row RGRID_ROW in array RGRID. Thus, if U0 is a basic system vector
! and UL is a vector in coord system L, then:
 
!                       U0 = T0L*UL                      (1)
 
! In the RCORD database, we have transformations, T0P, that transform a vector to basic (0) from the principal
! directions (P) of some other coordinate system. If the local (L) system is rectangular then T0P is T0L and all we
! have to do is get T0P from RCORD. However, if the local system is cylindrical or spherical, then we have to also
! transform from the point at R, THETA, Z (cylindrical) or R, THETA, PHI (spherical) to the respective principal axes
! of that cylindrical or spherical system. Thus, we can write eqn (1) as:
 
!                       U0 = T0P*UP                      (2)            
! and
!                       UP = TPL*UL                      (3)
 
! Substituting (3) into (2) and comparing with (1) it is seen that:
 
!                      T0L = T0P*TPL 
  
! For a rectangular system, TPL is the identity matrix.
 
! For a cylindrical system TPL is the matrix in the relationship:
 
!              |UPx|   |cos(THETA) -sin(THETA) 0 ||Ur    |
!              |UPy| = |sin(THETA)  cos(THETA) 0 ||Utheta|
!              |UPz|   |     0           0     1 ||Uz    |
 
! where UPx, UPy, UPz are the displacements in the principal directions of the cylindrical system and Ur, Utheta, Uz
! are the cylindrical system displacements at some coordinate location R, THETA, Z in the cylindrical system.
 
! For a spherical system TPL is the matrix in the relationship:
 
!  |UPx|   |sin(THETA)*cos(PHI) cos(THETA)*cos(PHI) -sin(PHI) ||Ur    |
!  |UPy| = |sin(THETA)*sin(PHI) cos(THETA)*sin(PHI)  cos(PHI) ||Utheta|
!  |UPz|   |    cos(THETA)          -sin(THETA)         0     ||Uphi  |
 
! where UPx, UPy, UPz are the displacements in the principal directions of the spherical system and Ur, Utheta, Uphi
! are the spherical system displacements at some coordinate location R, THETA, PHI in the spherical system.
