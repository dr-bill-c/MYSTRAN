! Each row of GRID is for one grid point and contains:

!              (2) After subr GRID_PROC it is in grid point numerical order

! Sorting of arrays:
! ------------------
!  1) After the Bulk Data has been read, all of the above arrays are in the order in which the elems were read from the B.D. deck.
!     Thus, at this point, ESORT2 is an array of consecutive integers starting with 1 and ending with NELE (the number of elements).
 
!  2) After subr ELESORT has run, arrays ESORT1, ESORT2, EOFF, EPNT, ETYPE are sorted together such that the elems in ESORT1 are in
!     numerically increasing order. EDAT remains as it was constructed when the Bulk Data was read - in the order in which elems
!     were placed in the Bulk Data Deck.

!  PEB      : PEB = TE' x PEL

!  STEi     : These are the corrections that must be made to stresses calculated based on total element strains to subtract out the
!             stress due to the free thermal expansion part of the total strain (i.e. they are E*ALPHA*DT types of terms)

!  STRESS   : No's 1 - 3 are membrane stresses, no's 4 - 6 are bending stresses and no's 7, 8 are transverse shear stresses.
!             STRESS(9) not currently used. The transverse shear stresses are only used for calculating elem engineering forces
!             (so transverse shear elem forces can be output, but the transverse stress itself cannot be output)

!  XEB      : XEB has 1 more row than needed for the number of grids. The last row in XEB is a vector, measured from grid a, in the
!             basic coord directions, along the v vector.

!  ZS       : e.g. the Y, Z coords of 4 points on a CBAR cross-section at which to calc stresses
